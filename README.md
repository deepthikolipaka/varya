# Vayra

Vayra is an early-stage developer intelligence tool that helps developers **see and understand codebases visually**.

Upload a repository → Vayra parses your code → generates an interactive graph showing how functions, files, and modules connect.

---

### 🧠 Problem
Developers waste hours trying to understand existing codebases.  
Documentation gets outdated, and AI tools focus on writing code — not **explaining** it.  

---

### ⚙️ Solution
Vayra transforms static source code into an **interactive visual map**.  
It parses functions, modules, and relationships, displaying them as a live graph.  
Developers can explore, search, and comprehend code structures faster than ever.

---

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Building the MVP using **MERN stack**
- Parsing Python code with **Tree-sitter**
- Rendering interactive visualizations with **Cytoscape.js**

---

### 🧩 Tech Stack
React · Node.js · Express · MongoDB · Cytoscape.js · Tree-sitter

---

### 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] File upload & parsing  
- [ ] Function-level visualization  
- [ ] AI-powered summaries  
- [ ] Search and navigation  
- [ ] GitHub repo integration  

---

### 🧑‍💻 Status
🧱 MVP Development in progress — building core visualization and parsing pipeline.
